- Log in,
- Assign a gift exchange date and budget,
- Countdown with you to Christmas,
- Generate a group invite link to the draw,
- Automatically assign a name to you, excluding yourself,
- Allow you to add your likes and dislikes, or a wishlist of your own,
- Let other gift-givers send you tips and links to present ideas for the person you have drawn, anonymously!
